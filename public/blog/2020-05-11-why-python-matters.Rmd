The debate regarding "R versus Python" is one that is largely based on statistics versus CS/ML. Each language has its own advantages however, we can conclude that both languages are very useful and can actually work together. 

Here are example of differences between R and Rython:

After becoming very familiar with R all semester, learning about Python was quite interesting. We can use library(reticulate) to conduct some python coding in RStudio. Lets begin by trying out some basic codes. 
```{R}
#R code chunk
library(reticulate)
hi<-"Hello"
```

```{python}
#Python code chunk
hi="world"
print(r.hi,hi)  #access R-defined objects with r
```

```{R}
#R code chunk
cat(c(hi,py$hi))
```
The core python data science stacks are the following: 

-Jupyter:interactive notebook

-Numpy:numerical computing in Python

-Matplotlib:plotting in Python

-pandas: complex data structures for Python

-SciPy:scientific Python tools

-Scikit-learn:machine learning in Python

We can import numpy in order to gain access to a suite of functions. This will allow us to perform basic calculations as well as assign values to variables. A basic understanding of python gives us access to a large pool of tools that we can use to analyze data and create simple functions.  
```{python}
import numpy as np
x=np.array([1,2,3])
x
print(x/2+1) #vectorized arithmetic
x.shape #size of array (attribute)
```
Python is a very efficient language that allows us to run very complex codes as well. Gene sequencing can be conducted by using Python. We can create a function that takes a string of nucleotides as inputs and returns a dictionary with all 3-mers present in that string.Furthermore, this function can also inform us about the number of times that each 3-mer occurs. 

```{python}

my_seq1 = "ATCATCATG"
def count_kmers(read, k):
    counts = {}
    num_kmers = len(read) - k + 1
    for i in range(num_kmers):
        kmer = read[i:i+k]
        if kmer not in counts:
            counts[kmer] = 0
        counts[kmer] += 1
    return counts

count_kmers("ATCATCATG",3)
```

```{python}
my_seq2 = "CAGCCCAATCAGGCTCTACTGCCACTAAACTTACGCAGGATATATTTACGCCGACGTACT"
def count_kmers(read, k):
    counts = {}
    num_kmers = len(read) - k + 1
    for i in range(num_kmers):
        kmer = read[i:i+k]
        if kmer not in counts:
            counts[kmer] = 0
        counts[kmer] += 1
    return counts
count_kmers("CAGCCCAATCAGGCTCTACTGCCACTAAACTTACGCAGGATATATTTACGCCGACGTACT",3)
```
Python as you can see is amazing. There is no limit to what python can do!
